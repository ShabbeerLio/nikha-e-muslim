              Feast IQ is more than a fitness app—it’s your AI-powered lifestyle
              partner. The app creates customized meal plans and workout
              routines tailored to your daily calorie requirements, body type,
              and personal goals. From weight loss to muscle gain or overall
              wellness, Feast IQ adapts to your needs.
            </p>
            <p>
              Every meal suggestion comes with detailed information, including
              the exact ingredients, step-by-step preparation methods, and even
              a direct link to a YouTube video so you can cook with confidence.
              The same approach is applied to workouts—clear routines, guided
              steps, and video demonstrations to help you exercise safely and
              effectively, no matter your fitness level.
            </p>
